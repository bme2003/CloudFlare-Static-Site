            From just about as early as I can remember, I have played videogames. I remember the first instance of videogames, and it was when my dad was playing “Ratchet and Clank” on the PlayStation 2. 
            I was extremely interested; how can he be using a remote to control what is essentially a person on the TV to shoot aliens?! From that point on, I loved watching my dad play and eventually beginning to play games myself.  
            I went from playing on that PlayStation2, to a Nintendo DS, to a PS3, PS4, and so forth.  Playing games both alone and with people as it is something that is incomparable to most activities, yet you can do just about any activity in gaming.  
            Gaming culture has shaped me as an individual since a very young age, and this culture will continue to shape individuals for years to come. It helped me develop my own sense of an identity along with gain many, many friends. It also holds various negative impacts on my own and other people’s lives. 
            When explaining and understanding gaming culture, it’s hard to grasp as it is similar in ways to sports; you must play the game to understand the lingo.  It is also very easy to misconstrue the idea of an individual involved in this community through extreme generalizing and stereotypes. 
            Through personal experience and research however, Gaming culture can be understood from its impact on individuals, the language and customs created, along with a look at the average “identity” that can be seen.

            Gaming culture can have an extreme impact on people, both negative and positive. This impact affects just about all aspects of an individual, being physical, mental, and emotionally. From my personal view, it has impacted me mostly positively. 
            I have built amazing friendships from playing online videogames, spending many hours playing with these individuals to work towards a common goal, to win that match, finish that game, or beat them in a 1V1. Through my experiences, I have also had some awful times.
            A term that is used a lot when relating to this community is “Toxicity”. Toxicity relates to individuals who are problematic and harass individuals online. There is also another term in gaming, called “Trash Talking”. 
            Trash talking refers to the fact that when individuals are grouped up and playing games together, typically you end up “trash” talking your friends. Typically, this lies in a friendly manner, as it is all in good fun and meant to make one another laugh. 
            The line between these two concepts is a grey area however, mostly because you cannot really know when someone thinks something is a “joke” unless they clearly outline it. A lot of the time this trash talking can also get out of control and lead to a toxic relationship formed between individuals. 
            According to Raymond, they state, “The gaming community containing toxic, problematic, and ignorant players is not a new issue. While, admittedly, “trash-talk” is a part of the gaming experience, there is a fine line between occasional banter and literal harassment.
            Criticizing someone based on their ability to play a game is one thing but using sexism or homophobia to draw conclusions about one’s ability is a whole other. There needs to be changes made in gaming culture, by both individuals and companies, to make the community a safer, less toxic place.”. 
            Individuals in the gaming community that hold these mindsets of trying to gatekeep it and harass individuals that are different from themselves are the root of the problem. I have dealt with many people like this playing popular titles like “Call of Duty” and “Valorant”, although it has been rare for me.
            Raymond explains and goes into depth the hardships that a lot of individuals face when entering this community, such as women, members of the LGBTQ+ community, and so many others. The shared values of gamers in this community are way different than what can seem like that overwhelming negativity, as most individuals are simply looking to play a fun game with or without company. 
            In this community, hateful individuals will latch onto parts of your identity that is either personal or marginalized and attack it, using racism, homophobia, and a slew of slurs. 
            This is what makes so many individuals so varyingly impacted by this community, from extreme negatives to the point where they aren’t even a part of it anymore to people who make their livelihood in this community, cherishing it with their lives and creating subcommunities within this massive community. 
            The shared value of majority of gamers is they are accepting of all and just wanting to play a fun, fair, and exciting game, but the few affect the many.

            The process of comprehensive coverage of the entirety of world history is extremely challenging to summarize in the limited pages The Ways of the World contains. In doing so key factors of major civilizations are left out, such as the military conquest of the Romans.
            The information we are given is surface-level to the intricate strategic military conquest, as well as the socio-economic foundations driving it. Through Strayer and Nelson’s writing, it is learned that the Romans had a rags-to-riches story, and developed their empire through their highly praised political elite and their warrior society (Strayer.114). 
            Doyle presents the in-depth key factors that were driving the new world power, citing their social foundation for imperialism and their flexible democracy. Rome's strong emphasis on democracy and politics led to several alliances amongst the Latin leagues, creating a nation backed by many (Doyle.84). 
            These alliances are what begins the disparity between Carthage and Rome, which is heavily disregarded in the text. Rome turned against Macedonia to protect their Greek counterparts, creating a breach in their alliance, and turning the Greeks into new Roman subjects. 
            This became another shortcoming of evidence in the textbook as the new focus of Rome is stated as “It is thus to Roman society and Roman Politics that we must turn to discover other roots of expansion” (Doyle.85). 
            The Ways of the World continues to focus on the key events solely transpiring during this period, rather than the ultimate building and forming of a new world superpower.

            The gaming community has an extremely large following and it can mostly be viewed from the streaming service called “Twitch”. Twitch has a base of content creators who live stream videogames, ranging from essentially every genre of game. 
            The subcommunities of these streamers along with their respective games have such a diverse language base with terms and lingo that can be so misunderstood if you are not a part of it. Certain phrases you will hear with just about every subcommunity within gaming is “GG”.
            First glance and that might have a completely different meaning then you think it means, but it means “Good Game”, used in good etiquette to your opponent in this community. Terms like this are made up with good and bad connotation and are rampant among the community.
            I personally use quite a few of them when I play because the people I play with can also relate to what I am trying to convey to them. According to Hanney, they state, “The popularity of video games on the Internet has helped pave the way for special terms to be created by its players.
            From this, an innovative sublanguage was formed, which consisted of new words and abbreviations that have helped the online community to communicate and cooperate with one another”. Teamwork along with the feeling of community is what has strengthened these languages along with the various customs. 
            Expectations associated to behavior in certain titles is one of the main customs formed within this community. Certain playstyles and mechanics related to a genre of a game are formed by these customs and then hold their own form of a connotative attachment, good or bad.
            One of the most common customs that is held is saying the phrase “GG” to the opponent, win or loss, as a sign of respect. Not saying “GG” is typically frowned upon and often leads to you being known as a toxic individual. 
            The biggest takeaway from these customs and the language base of this community is how over the course of time it has developed, along with the meaning and impact it has on individuals when using these terms along with them.
            This held values have existed since the culture just about began, giving a sense of belonging to those who know how to ‘talk the talk’ with their favorite videogames. The values and language base associated to an individual also helps form the identities of each person.

            When thinking about the gaming community, many stereotypes can be thought of as to what the average gamer looks like. Many stereotypes hold a negative understanding of individuals and incorrectly assume a lot on people’s lives. 
            I personally have experienced this, from being called a nerd/geek, loser, along with many others. Many people turn away from this community because it is easy to take it out of control and lose many aspects of your life. 
            According to Fu, they state, “Gaming disorder is defined as behavior “characterized by impaired control over gaming, increasing priority given to gaming over other activities to the extent that gaming takes precedence over other interests and daily activities, and continuation or escalation of gaming despite the occurrence of negative consequences” (World Health Organization, 2018).
            Petry, et al. (2014) state that, unlike general internet addiction, gaming disorder clearly shows an increase in risk for clinically significant issues. It has been associated with food and sleep deprivation, seizures, and even death among youths.”. 
            Although this community can hold various negatives on physical and mental health, it is important to take all aspects of life with balance. Fu explains that imbalance, which can show a few things about the values held by a member of this community. 
            Typically, gamers hold an extreme love for the game and will sacrifice a lot to keep playing, like athletes or people in demanding careers. This characteristic is very common with people among this community, as you have to ‘grind’ to win.
            I have had issues with this balance before, the outlet of videogames as an escape from the hardships of reality can be very intoxicating. I am just very thankful that I have come to understand that life is full of differing experiences and communities, and it is important to spread your time and efforts over various activities. 
            Gamers also have an amazing creative skill and have an immense imagination, as it takes a gamer to make an amazing game. The biggest aspect to many gamers is friendship and community, because of the need for teamwork and cooperation in various games. 
            Gaming is how I believe there can be amazing true connect between individuals, because most everybody can participate in videogames of all genres and form their own bonds with other people, making the “average” identity associated with gaming culture to be only identifiable by one phrase: wanting to play.

            Gaming culture is a very large, diverse, and unique community. Through my life, I have always played games and developed many friends in this culture. 
            I am very fortunate to have this outlet in my life, as it is one of the biggest joys I hold in my life, and I can’t imagine how my life would have shaped out to be without this. 
            With that, everybody has a unique experience with gaming culture. It can be a lead to a plethora of issues such as bullying, harassment, racism, homophobia, all due to individuals that hold an indifference to others. 
            On that same idea, it can also be the best part of one’s life. I see it as all dependent on luck, from the game you decide to play, if you decide to play multiplayer games, the subcommunities you fall into through gaming, it all just happens by chance.
            The only way to truly know and experience this culture is to be a part of it, with the understanding of what makes up this community in mind.
            That is also the other amazing aspect of gaming, the diversity involved. There is so many types of games, so many different players, with so many ways to play.

            When approaching this project, I looked into HTML tags and essentially went off their name and common use case to use them as I wanted. I used a lot of header tags to 
            Differentiate titles of certain areas and give appropriate font size to such. I also used section to divide the section along and p tags to have different
            fonts for different parts of the reading to give a more aesthetic look to the page. Besides that, the job divides itself into creating tags, filling it with content
            , and closing the tags accordingly. I plan to use Times New Roman Font with just varying sizes to allow for easy navigation between my 3 headers, being the writing,
            addendum, and works cited. I also plan to use the footer tag to give myself expressed rights to release and publish my own document onto the web.
