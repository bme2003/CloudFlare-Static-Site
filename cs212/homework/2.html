            Throughout history, there have been several vital civilizations that have shaped the world into what it is today. Very large contributors to this are the ancient civilizations of China, Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Rome. These nations have been dissected by historians throughout time, and have been ascribed for their long-lasting human advancements. The book Ways of the World with Sources, Volume 1 by Robert Strayer and Eric Nelson takes the history of the world, in a broad concept, from prehistory to the 15th century. It focuses on and accentuates these first civilizations with the inability to focus on and depict the specifics of their operations of life. In turn, this reading is enhanced and supported through scholarly works such as The Cambridge Illustrated History of China by Patrick Buckley Ebrey, Empires by Michael Doyle, and Days of Empire by Amy Chua. The ability to have secondary sources that articulate the small details they aren’t defining factors in these civilizations illuminates the overall importance of these human-defining kingdoms.

            The Shang Dynasty contributed to the early military advancements of the human race, with the development of bronze-tipped spears, composite bows, and others (Ebrey.24). These developments are merely limited within the textbook and brought into life with Ebrey’s piece. We are given a short segment during the second chapter of the textbook describing the advancements of the usage of bronze and the lavish furnishings they used. Strayer describes the Shang in little detail given by “substantially enlarged the Chinese state, erected lavish tombs for their rulers, and buried thousands of human sacrificial victims to accompany them in the next world” (Strayer.61). The continuous depiction of life during the Shang dynasty is not explored into the great depths of impact they made while ruling. While dissecting the same quote, it is stated that there were human sacrificial victims, as well as merely stating the “possibility of human sacrifice." (Strayer.61). Ebrey not only covers this topic but dives deeper into the inhumane ways of sacrificial behavior, with evidence of buried victims. She directly states the textual evidence and the practice of human sacrifice in tomb 101 at Anyang (Ebrey.24). Ebrey takes the devotion of Shang kings in their mass sacrificial behaviors describing not only their innate reasoning to sacrifice to local spirits, but also adding in animals for royal ancestors and nature gods. This is completely left out by Strayer and Nelson in their depiction of the Shang dynasty and other first-era civilizations, and heavily supported and reinforced by Ebrey’s work.

            The process of comprehensive coverage of the entirety of world history is extremely challenging to summarize in the limited pages The Ways of the World contains. In doing so key factors of major civilizations are left out, such as the military conquest of the Romans. The information we are given is surface-level to the intricate strategic military conquest, as well as the socio-economic foundations driving it. Through Strayer and Nelson’s writing, it is learned that the Romans had a rags-to-riches story, and developed their empire through their highly praised political elite and their warrior society (Strayer.114). Doyle presents the in-depth key factors that were driving the new world power, citing their social foundation for imperialism and their flexible democracy. Rome's strong emphasis on democracy and politics led to several alliances amongst the Latin leagues, creating a nation backed by many (Doyle.84). These alliances are what begins the disparity between Carthage and Rome, which is heavily disregarded in the text. Rome turned against Macedonia to protect their Greek counterparts, creating a breach in their alliance, and turning the Greeks into new Roman subjects. This became another shortcoming of evidence in the textbook as the new focus of Rome is stated as “It is thus to Roman society and Roman Politics that we must turn to discover other roots of expansion” (Doyle.85). The Ways of the World continues to focus on the key events solely transpiring during this period, rather than the ultimate building and forming of a new world superpower.

            The rise and falls of civilizations were determined by a backfire of a power when they became too successful and overreached. Persia was defined by their ability to create and maintain a diverse coalition of people,  embraced by the ruler Cyrus (Chua.8). Day of Empire is able to represent Cryus the Great of Persia turned it into a once superpower in the world, and describe how he made Perisa such an affluent kingdom at one time. Only giving Cyrus the Great two sentences in the textbook cannot reflect the entirety and importance of his reign. Chua directly states Cyrus in many examples as being ‘worshiped’ and loved amongst his people, even staring at a parade Cyrus “appeared so great and so goodly to look upon” (Chua.10). A piece of information so grazed over in the textbook is the freeing of the Jews back to Jerusalem and building them a temple. This is misconstrued in the fact that Cyrus did this, and much more for them. He not only built the temple out of his own expense, but also restored “the vessels of gold and silver” that were taken to Babylon previously (Chua.11). Cyrus is also a key factor in maintaining social control in his empire because he respected and embraced local traditions of lands he had previously conquered, and now new subjects under the Persian Empire. Leaving out key details of why an empire is successful does not do justice to the ones who built and maintained it. Chua demonstrates a wide variety of primary sources which elevates the piece to a new level, quoting several direct connections to Cyrus at the time demonstrating his good press.

            Being able to cover the entirety of world history is a very impressive feat by Robert Strayer and Eric Nelson, yet cannot cover the very minute details of everything. The utilization of the secondary sources elevated and supported Ways of the World and provides for a more comprehensible understanding of the information being covered.
