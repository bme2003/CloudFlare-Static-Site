    <h1> Lab 3: Serving Fonts, Brody England</h1>
    <p> For this lab, I decided to use Google Fonts, taking their API Link for the font I chose and then pasting the given link into the head tag of my webpage and using CSS to associate the body of my writing to the font I chose.</p>
    <p> I decided to go with a "Pixelify Sans" as it was still human readable but it was pretty unique, and by essentially copy and pasting the link given to me from Google Fonts
    I was able to then associate the body of my webpage to the font family from there. </p>
